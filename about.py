	<center><h1>About Us</h1></center>
	<p>A virtual classroom is an online learning environment that allows for live interaction between the tutor and the learners as they are participating in learning activities.</br>
	Students do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing prepackaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write reflectively about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves.  time to step up to the plate and get passionate about your work commit to making eLearning courses that don't bore people to tears, but instead inspire and motivate them to learn a new skill, change a certain behavior, or improve their performance.</br>
	In other words, the virtual classroom is a shared online space where the learners and the tutor work together simultaneously. Usually, these interactions take place through videoconferencing. The participants have tools to present learning content in different formats, as well as to implement collaborative and individual activities. In this type of interaction, the teacher has the particularly important role of the moderator who guides the learning process and supports group activities and discussions.

	<center><h1>Vision</h1></center>
	<p> 
	One of my goals, as a teacher, is to change the classroom from merely a room where students come to take notes to a forum where learning on the spot takes place, where self-confidence is built and exercised, where personal interactions with others are nurtured and developed. Sadly, the classroom is one of the most underutilized resources in teaching. Instead of being the engine of education, it often takes the back seat role.
In developing my teaching philosophy, I have taken cues from innovative educators (like Richard Felder, Professor of Chemical Engineering at North Carolina State University, and Eric Mazur, Professor of Applied Physics at Harvard), found inspiration from those who have taught me, and basically listened to my own instincts. Described below are some of the different strategies that I follow to create my vision of the classroom.
</p><p>
The classroom should be inviting. Establishing a personal and individual rapport with the students sets the stage for this environment. At minimum, I learn the names of all the students in the course. I take advantage of opportunities, like time right before and after class, to mingle with the students. I also hold office hours on the student's turf--in the undergraduate chemical engineering lounge--so that the atmosphere is informal and inclusive.

	<center><h1>Mission</h1></center>
	<p>
	After being out of the classroom for the past two years, and returning to teaching biology this year, I have really been thinking about my role in education and my goals for this year.  I have thought about what changes I want to make since I was last in the classroom and this was a great opportunity to really start formulating a plan.   
This is what I have come up with so far.  It is a work in progress.  I think the 21st Century Learner idea is getting a little old and overused, but these are skills I really want my students to leave my class with.
 My students will be 21st Century learners.  They will be able to think critically about the curriculum and how it relates to their lives outside of the classroom. They will be able to communicate effectively with their peers, their teachers, the community, and the world.  They will be able to collaborate and work well with others.  And they will be creative in sharing what they have learned and their passions. 
The mission of virtual classroom is to provide a learning environment where all students will succeed, are a valued part of the community, are prepared for their futures, and become lifelong learners.
You may have noticed that I did not specifically mention technology in my vision or mission. While I am a huge fan of integrating technology in my classroom, and have spent the last two years as an Instructional Technology Specialist, tech is not my main focus.  My focus in the classroom is and has always been the students and their learning and growth. Technology will be a big part of my classroom, but technology is just a tool that when used at the right time, can help students become 21st century learners.
